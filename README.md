# FOMAL_heroku
A sentiment analysis bot, scanning different subreddits to look for specific words (in my case currencies but it is easy to change), prepared to deploy on heroku, only having to configure the PostgreSQL database, and a telegram bot to tell the results of the analysis. Hope to improve it at some point, when I have more time.
